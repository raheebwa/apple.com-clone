### Project Goal
In this project the goal is to clone the website of one of the most design-forward companies in the world. Itâ€™s not a very complex site but it uses background photos well and the navbar at the top contains a gradient that should be mimicked.

Clone [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/) applying only HTML & CSS.
